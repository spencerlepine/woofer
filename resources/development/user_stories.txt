Swipe Page Potential Dog/Swipe Generator:
- Loading Swipe page should render loading circle until Dog is retrieved
- Should call API to look for next dog
- API call should pass along DOG ID
- API endpoint should reference "match queue" database for this User FIRST, then look for dogs in "zip codes pool" database of this User.
- API calls should reference previous matches to make sure there was no swipe already. Possible match should verify dogA never matched dogB previously, or dogB rejected dogA.
- API endpoint should verify preferences for DogA profile (age, breed, zodiac...)
- API endpoint should return potential match dogId, name, bio, and photos

Swipe YES Button Action:
- Users can click YES on a dog profile
- Clicking button should call database with DogA and DogB ids
- API endpoint should test if it is a FIRST time swipe, or mutually YES
     > For a first time YES, API endpoint will update database and add thisDog to thatDog's match queue records as a "MATCH/True". Nothing will happen in Dog thisDog client, just load the next profile.
     > For a mutually YES, see "Match Example"

Match Example:
-  "DogA Client"generates random dog (DogB) from zip code Pool
-  "DogA Client" swiped YES on DogB
- "DogA Client" adds DogA to <"match queue database" under DogBId "document/array">
-  "DogB Client" opens swipe page, also swipes YES on DogA
- "DogB Client" removes DogA from <"match queue database" under DogBId "document + array">
- "DogB Client" adds DogA to <"match records database" under DogBId "document + object">
- "DogB Client" add DogB to <"match queue database" under DogAId "document + object">
- "DogB Client" creates a chat with default message "Woof! DogB just matched with you - say hi :P"
- "DogB Client" renders Match Popup with link to OPEN chat
- If EVERYTHING worked, Remove DogA from "DogB Match Queue"

Swipe NO Button Action:
- Users can click NO on a dog profile
- Clicking button should call database with DogA and DogB ids
- API endpoint should test if it is a FIRST no, or a rejection:
     > If thatDog is from the MatchQueue, it is a rejection:
     > Otherwise, if this is a first time NO, API endpoint will add thisDog to thatDog's match queue records as a "REJECTION/False".
